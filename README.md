# About me

Hi I'm Max, I'm a mathematical/philosophical logician by training, currently teaching myself Haskell mostly by solving coding challenges in it.

# Current projects

* Finding a space- and time-efficient implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm in Haskell (much harder than I would have thought), initiated by Advent of Code 2021 Day 15.
* Writing a little `ascii-art` library in Haskell, initiated by wanting to pretty print the result of inefficient path-finding algorithms, like all non-looping paths through a grid.
* Finding a day job, so feel free to get in touch!
